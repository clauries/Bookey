#### [Deployed App](#)

## Concept
As a reader, I want to search Google Books for quality book information so that I can quickly find books to read and where to purchase them.

## Local Installation and Usage
1. Install the required modules by typing "npm install" or "npm i" using your code editor terminal; must be at the same level as the package.json.
2. Run the app by typing "npm start", "node server.js", or "node server."
3. The console log will display "Server listening on: http://localhost:3000 ."
4. You can hold control and click on the address to go directly to the app.

## Tech Utilized
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Material-UI
* Node
* NPM
* Express
* FS
* MongoDB

## Future Development
* Better image formmatting - currently the images appear zoomed in. Would like to work with Material-ui styling to create clearer images of the book covers. 
* Authentication system - Would like to develop a login/profile system. Currently this app supports one user/list of books. Would be great if multiple users can have their own lists.
* Various lists of books - user can categorize their book saves. 
* Read book button - user can move a book to their "read books" list and add a review/notes for themselves or others to read. 
* Connect to a library system - would be awesome to also search a library for books. Would need to change db links from around the name & image to buttons. So you would have a "buy book" and a "borrow book" button.


## Credits
* App heavily influenced by activities through my current bootcamp [(Univeristy of Oregon's Coding BootCamp)](https://bootcamp.uoregon.edu/) - particularly Week 21, Activity 5. 
* Material-UI - utilized many of their components.
