#### [Deployed App](#)

## Concept
As a reader, I want to search Google Books for quality book information so that I can quickly find books to read and where to purchase them.

## Local Installation and Usage
1. Install the required modules by typing "npm install" or "npm i" using your code editor terminal; must be at the same level as the package.json.
2. Run the app by typing "npm start", "node server.js", or "node server."
3. The console log will display "Server listening on: http://localhost:3000 ."
4. You can hold control and click on the address to go directly to the app.
